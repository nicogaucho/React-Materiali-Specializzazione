# Rendering Strategies

----

## CSR - Client Side Rendering

* SPA (Single Page Application), tutto accade con JS nel browser
* Deployed a una CDN

----

## SSG - Static Site Generation

* Le pagine sono renderizzate al momento della compilazione, il meno JS possibile nelle pagine risultanti
* Deployed a una CDN

----

## SSR - Server Side Rendered

* Le pagine vengono visualizzate in fase di esecuzione (quando un utente visita il sito), il meno JS possibile nelle pagine risultanti
* Deployed a un backend JS environment (VPS, Serverless, Edge etc.)

----

##  Hybrid

* SSG tutto il possibile al momento della costruzione (build time)
* SSR tutte le pagine che non erano SSG, renderizzate al primo caricamento
   * Successivi caricamenti possono comportarsi come CSR/SPA 
* Deployed a un backend JS environment (VPS, Serverless, Edge etc.)
